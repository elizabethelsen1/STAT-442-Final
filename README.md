# STAT-442-Final
All of the code used in my final project for STAT 442

Spotify Dataset found at: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/top-spotify-songs-in-73-countries-daily-updated/data)

The original dataset is too large to store on GitHub. The datasets provided will be sufficient to run the shiny apps and to follow the code past the shrinking from 1.4M data points to only 280K data points.
